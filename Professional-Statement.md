# Professional Statement

I am a detail-oriented professional with strong account management and data analysis background, as well as 5 years of experience working in federally regulated environments.
Having to handle sensitive client information, I am someone who values protecting data and upholding ethical security practices to safeguard both organizations and individuals.
With the increasing number of cyber attacks, and the lack of sufficient cybersecurity professionals, I am eager to do my part to secure digital environments. 

I am most interested in learning the ins-and-outs of penetration testing and threat detection, as cyberattacks have become more and more subtle.
With my experience in handling sensitive data in regulated environments, my strong foundation in data management and my passion for protecting the vulnerable citizens, I aim to support organizations in identifying vulnerabilities, enhancing compliance, and implementing proactive security measures.
